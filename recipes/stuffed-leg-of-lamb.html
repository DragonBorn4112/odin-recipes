    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (5 pound) boneless leg of lamb</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) bag fresh spinach leaves</li>
        <li>6 ounces goat cheese, or more if needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pine nuts</li>
        <li>kitchen twine</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="steps">
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove plastic netting or twine from around the leg of lamb, if any, and open up the roast on a cutting board. Place the boned side of the roast up. With a sharp paring knife, cut away any excess fatty areas. Use a sharp knife to cut 1/2-inch deep slits in the meat about 2 inches apart, to help the meat lie flat. Cover the meat with a sturdy piece of plastic wrap or a cut-apart food storage bag, and pound the meat with a mallet or the edge of a small plate until the roast is about 3/4 inch thick everywhere, and 10 to 14 inches square.</li>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the upper side of the meat with salt and pepper, and then spread spinach leaves over the top of the roast to within 1/2 inch of the edges. Break up the goat cheese and sprinkle it evenly over the spinach, then sprinkle the pine nuts over the cheese.</li>
        <li>Roll the roast up into a tight cylinder, and tie the roast together with kitchen twine at 2 inch intervals. It's okay if a little stuffing protrudes from the sides of the roast.</li>
        <li>In a flat dish, mix together the flour, 1 tablespoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of pepper, the thyme, and the fennel seeds, and press the tied roast firmly into the flour mixture to coat all sides.</li>
        <li>Heat the sesame oil in a heavy oven-proof or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until the oil shimmers, and sear all sides of the roast, including the ends, to a golden brown color. Lay the roast into the skillet, place into the preheated oven, and roast to your desired degree of doneness, or an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (65 degrees C) for medium, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
